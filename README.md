# AI Logo Generator

## About
This is an AI-powered logo generation service using a LoRA fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model. The model is deployed on **Render** and accessible via FastAPI and Gradio.

## Live Demo
Try it out here: [AI Logo Generator](https://ai-logo-lora-sdv1-5.onrender.com)

## Important Note
- The API has **limited free calls**, so the website may not always produce the desired output.
- If the model fails to generate an image, it may be due to **exhausted inference credits**.
- **Render's free tier suspends the service after 15 minutes of inactivity**. If the service is suspended and receives a request, it will **wake up with a cold start delay (~30+ seconds)** before responding.

## Usage
1. Visit the **Live Demo** link.
2. Enter a prompt describing the logo you want.
3. Click **Submit** to generate the logo.

## API Endpoint
You can also use the API directly:
```bash
GET https://ai-logo-lora-sdv1-5.onrender.com/generate/{prompt}
```
Example:
```bash
GET https://ai-logo-lora-sdv1-5.onrender.com/generate/aeroplane-blue-logo
